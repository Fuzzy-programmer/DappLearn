# DappLearn

This repository demonstrates how to build a basic **Decentralized Application (DApp)** using:

- Sample smart contracts written in **Solidity**
- A modern **frontend interface** to interact with the contracts

The goal is to help developers learn how to connect smart contracts deployed on a blockchain with a UI.


## 🧠 What’s Inside

📁 **contracts/**  
Solidity smart contracts (for example, token or storage contracts)

📁 **pages/**  
Frontend code (likely using a framework like React or Next.js)

📄 **package.json**  
Project configuration and dependencies


## 🚀 Features

- Example Solidity contracts demonstrating key blockchain logic
- Frontend code that interacts with contracts
- Easy-to-follow learning project for beginners


## 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** and **npm**
- **Metamask** (or any Web3 wallet) in your browser
- A local blockchain environment such as **Hardhat**, **Ganache**, or **Remix**


## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Fuzzy-programmer/DappLearn.git
   cd DappLearn
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```


## 📌 How to Run

### 1. Start the Frontend

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This will start the app (e.g., on localhost:3000) so you can open it in your browser.

### 2. Connect Your Wallet

Use **Metamask** to connect your wallet to:

* A local blockchain (Hardhat/Ganache)
* Or a testnet (like Sepolia)

### 3. Interact With Contracts

Once the frontend is running and your wallet is connected:

* Deploy the contracts
* Use the UI to call functions on them


## 📘 Project Flow

1. Write smart contracts in **Solidity**
2. Test & deploy them on a local blockchain
3. Use the frontend to interact with deployed contracts

This mimics how real-world DApps work.
